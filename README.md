## ðŸŽ‰ V2 is here

Welcome to the python api wrapper of [StudyGo](https://studygo.com).

## All features:
- Authentication based on email and password, can be done in bulk using multi-threading. It auto-requests a token.
- Additional tools such as Captcha solving (paid with capmonster), integrated multi-threading and extensive error handling.
- Interaction with the Q&A forum, having full control over all data.
- Groups; join and leave other groups.
- Being able to mass read accounts from files.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/HologramSteve/wrts-forum-api.git
cd wrts-forum-api 
```

2. Install packages
```
pip install requests
```

3. (Optional) Configure CAPTCHA solving:
- Set up CapMonster API key in captha.py

## Usage
### Single client usage
```python
from Base.Client import Client

# Initialize single client
client = Client("email@example.com", "password")

# Access forum manager
forum = client.Forum
posts = forum.fetchForumPosts()
```

### Forum interaction
```python
# Fetch specific post
post = client.Forum.fetchPost("post_id")

# Answer a post
post.answer("Your answer content here")

# Like an answer
for answer in post.answers:
    if not answer.liked:
        answer.like()
```

## Multiple client usage
The `accounts.txt` file must contain at least 1 account in the format `email:password`.
Then use a `ClientCluster` instead of normal `Client` and you're set!
